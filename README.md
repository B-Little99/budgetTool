**Overview** 
This programme is meant to help people create a budget and see where their cashflow goes each month. There is different categories of bills to reflect the different purchases of a consumer such as household bills, annual bills, travel bills and non-essential bills.

The program is meant to provide flexibility for the users. To do this I ensured that users have the option to add bills that are not specifically stated in the bill categories and the programme enables users to input floats or ints.

Over time the program developed and was more obvious that it needed to be more readable, because if a user added a long digit it would not be readable in the total. To make it more readable I used the Â£ sign and used commas to break up the numbers so it improved readability when working with longer numbers.

Overall this project enabled me to get used to the Python programming language and I learnt a lot more about what you can do in Python.
